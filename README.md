## Overview

- The goal of this project is to have codes for various data structures and algorithms - in C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Go, JavaScript and PHP. 
- Feel free to contribute in any way you want.
- Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.



## Algure Contribution

This class solves any arithmetic equation with the function "gunnercal" and observes the rules of BODMAS while doing so.
Logarithmic and trigonometric functions can also be evaluated with the following key phrases as input: 
NOTE: ALGORITHM IS CASE SENSITIVE

-Alog: Antilog e.g Alog0.1=Alog(0.1)=1.25

-Asin: ArcSine e.g Asin0.5=Asin(0.5)=30

-Acos: ArcCosine e.g Acos(0.5)=Acos(0.5)=60

-Atan: ArcTangent e.g Atan1= Atan(1)=45

-ln: Natural Logarithe.g ln1=ln(1)=0

-log: logarithm e.g log10=log(10)=1

-sin: Sine e.g sin30=sin(30)=0.5

-cos: Cosine e.g cos60=cos(60)=0.5

-tan: Tangent e.g tan45=tan(45)=1

-e: exponential e.g e5=e(5)=148.4

-!: factorial e.g 6!=720

-^: power e.g 2^3=8 2^-1=0.5

-Regular arithmetic:+,-,*,/,(,)etc.

Sample input: gunnercal("2+3(cos(35+5^2)+log10)")
Sample output: "6.5"

Space complexity: O(n)=>linear

## Content

- We currently have 4 folders for 8 programming languages - C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Go, JavaScript and PHP.
- **Do not create folders in your submissions, unless specifically told to do so.**

<br/>

**YOU CANNOT CREATE A PR DIRECTLY. YOU NEED TO BE ASSIGNED AN ISSUE. IF THE ISSUE DOES NOT EXIST, CREATE ONE, ASK FOR IT IN YOUR PREFERRED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND WAIT FOR IT TO BE ASSIGNED TO YOU. NOT FOLLOWING THIS WILL BE CONSIDERED A VIOLATION**

<br/>

## Contribution Guidelines

- Issues will be assigned on a **_first come, first serve_ basis**. The person who creates the issue gets the first priority. And then, issues are assigned based on who commented first. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned and the **programming language** you should be assigned in, and it will be done if found fit.
- You cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- If you have anything else in mind, FEEL FREE TO CREATE AN ISSUE and please wait for it to be assigned to you. If assigned to you, then you can start working on it and create a PR.
- **All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and then create a PR.**
- **In your code file, add (Inside a multiline comment) Sample Input and Output at the end of the file along with Time and Space Complexity.**
- Every time you add a file via a Pull Request also update the README.md file for that particular language in **Alphabetical Order** in the same PR. You'll find a README.md file in each language folder.
- **Plagiarism is not encouraged and a plagiarized PR won't be accepted at all.**
- **PR should be created within a week of you being assigned to it.**
- **At no point of time, you can claim more than 4 issues i.e. you can have at max 4 working issues, for this repository, at any point of time.**

### Where to upload the files

**PLEASE READ THIS**

- Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Data Structure in C-Plus-Plus, it goes inside the C-Plus-Plus folder and so on)
- Edit the corresponding _README.md_ file to **add the link to your code in the corresponding section** ([GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
